## Game of Tag C++ Project

This project is a C++ recreation of the Blueprint game from the video "Building a game of Tag using Behavior Trees in Unreal Engine 4" by *Paul Gestwicki*. The original video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/vXtfOM4Vy8w).

This game forms a section in my University Dissertation on comparisons between Blueprints and C++, and is part of an overarching chapter on game engines as a whole. The Unreal section concludes as to why the best approach to Unreal game development is to implement games in Unreal using both Blueprints and C++.
Most elements of the game are implemented in C++, aside from the use of the Blackboard, Behaviour Tree (which uses C++ Tasks and Services), and parts such as the animation system.

Git commits are not present as they are from the original repository.
