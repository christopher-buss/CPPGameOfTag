## Game of Tag C++ Project

This project is a C++ recreation of the Blueprint game from the video "Building a game of Tag using Behavior Trees in Unreal Engine 4" by *Paul Gestwicki*. The original video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/vXtfOM4Vy8w).

This project forms a section of my University Dissertation on comparisons between Blueprints and C++, and is part of an overarching chapter on game engines as a whole, as well as why the best practices are to implement games in Unreal using both Blueprints and C++ (as many simple tasks in Blueprints are tedious and time-consuming in C++). 
The AI components of the game are currently missing, but are intended to be added at a later date as the documentation for pure C++ AI implementations are lacking (as Blackboards and Behaviour Trees are the intended way to create AI even if the implementations themselves can be in C++).

Git commits are not present as they are from the original repository.
